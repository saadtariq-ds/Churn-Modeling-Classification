# Churn-Modeling-Classification
 
This repository contains a Churn Classification model built using TensorFlow and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. A Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

## Features
- Deep Learning Model: Uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Interactive UI: Powered by Streamlit for real-time predictions.
- Data Preprocessing: Automates feature scaling and encoding.
